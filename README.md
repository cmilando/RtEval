# RtEval

## Outline

* The goal of this repository is to evaluate software packages for estimating the effective reproduction number.
* We do this by fitting models from a range of software packages to simulated and real data
* In the future, these data will be stored in another repository ("`rtdata`")
* In the future, we will summarise the output of each package consistently using the [`summrt`](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/summrt) R package
* We hope that this repository will contain evaluations which are run semi-regularly using [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) so as to serve as a living, rather than static, comparison

## Structure

Remains to scope!

## Set-up

To run the code in this repository you'll need at least R version 4.0.0:

```r
required_version <- "4.0.0"
if (getRversion() < required_version) {
  stop(paste("Your R version is", getRversion(), ". Please update to version", required_version, "or higher."))
} else {
  cat(paste("R version is sufficient:", getRversion(), "\n"))
}
```

You will also need these packages:

```r
install.packages(
  c(
    "rmarkdown", "shiny", "knitr", "plotly",
    "purrr", "splines", "tidyverse", "readr",
    "EpiLPS", "EpiNow2", "lubridate", "rstan",
    "cmdstanr", "R0", "remotes", "ggpubr",
    "ggtext", "lemon", "patchwork"
  )
)

remotes::install_github("dajmcdon/rtestim")

install.packages("EpiEstim", repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```
